# AI-Driven Nutritional Insights : Using IBM Granite to Decode Menu Health Profile & Recommendations 

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project analyzes nutritional data from restaurant menu items using an AI-driven approach powered by IBM Granite (via Replicate). By leveraging large language model reasoning, we extract concise insights and actionable recommendations to help restaurants improve menu health profiles and guide consumers toward better choices.

## ðŸ’¡ Insight & Findings
- **Calories**: Average content is high; poses obesity and metabolic risk.
- **Fat**: Elevated fat may increase cardiovascular disease risk.
- **Sodium**: High sodium levels linked to hypertension.
- **Carbs & Sugars**: Contribute to diabetes and weight gain.

**Recommendations (AI-generated):**
- Reduce fat and sodium content using healthier ingredients and cooking methods.
- Improve menu transparency through labeling.
- Offer balanced portions and alternative options.

## ðŸ¤– AI Support Explanation

IBM Granite (via Replicate) serves as the **core reasoning engine** throughout this project. It was used to:
- Summarize numeric data into concise health risk insights.
- Generate structured recommendations in bullet point format.
- Suggest final visualization and provide Python code snippet.
- Enable executive-ready summaries quickly and clearly.

All prompts were optimized to remain concise, reducing risk of memory errors while maintaining clarity and actionable value.
