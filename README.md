# AI-Driven Nutritional Insights : Using IBM Granite to Decode Menu Health Profile & Recommendations 

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project analyzes the nutritional profiles of restaurant menu items using an AI-driven approach. By leveraging IBM Granite as the core reasoning engine, we aim to uncover actionable insights on calories, fat, sodium, carbohydrates, and sugars to help restaurants improve their offerings and guide consumers toward healthier choices. The project combines statistical analysis, visual exploration, and advanced AI-generated recommendations tailored for executive decision-making.

## ðŸ’¡ Insight & Findings
- **Calories**: Average content is high, with some items exceeding 600 kcal per serve. This poses risks for weight gain and associated health issues.
- **Fat**: Average fat content suggests a diet high in saturated fat, which may contribute to cardiovascular disease.
- **Sodium**: Many menu items contain sodium levels above daily recommended intake, potentially increasing hypertension risk.
- **Carbohydrates & Sugars**: High sugar content in several items can contribute to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

**Recommendations (AI-generated):**
- Offer leaner protein sources and plant-based alternatives.
- Use healthier cooking methods (grilling, steaming) to reduce fat.
- Reduce sodium through alternative seasoning or menu reformulation.
- Provide clear nutritional labeling to help consumers make informed decisions.
- Promote portion control and balanced meal options.

## ðŸ¤– AI Support Explanation

IBM Granite (via Replicate) served as the core analytical reasoning engine in this project. Its role included:
- Converting statistical summaries into detailed, executive-level insights.
- Generating structured, professional recommendations in bullet-point style.
- Suggesting and drafting Python code snippets for further visualization.
- Acting as an interactive analysis assistant via Pandas dataframe agent for querying additional insights.
